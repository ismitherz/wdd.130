            <p>Hello! My name is Isaac Smith and I am from nothern California.  This is my third semester here at BYU-I and I am going to start my mission on July 22.  I am a Computer Engineering major and I don't know what I want to do with that yet but I love engineering so that's one of the reasons I chose it.  I love sports and I play pickleball, golf, go mountain biking, skiing, and recently I've started to get into running.</p>
